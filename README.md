# Nodex

An Electron desktop starter powered by React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This launches both the Vite dev server (renderer) and Electron with live reload.

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The command bundles the renderer into `dist/` and compiles the Electron main + preload scripts into `dist-electron/`.
